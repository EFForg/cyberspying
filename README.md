===================

This is a Twitter action tool that EFF has used to fight awful cybersecurity bills in Congress. It was first designed to fight CISPA in 2012, then the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, then CISPA again in 2013.

It included embed code, and at times this tool has used the Sunlight API to target local representatives.

Parts of the code has been [reworked by ACLU](http://jezebel.com/5926786/tweet-generator-hilariously-spams-abortion+restricting-lawmakers-with-serious-vagina-questions) to fight for abortion rights.

See it in action at [https://cyberspying.eff.org/](https://cyberspying.eff.org/).
